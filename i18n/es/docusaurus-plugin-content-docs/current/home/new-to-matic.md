Polygon is a scaling solution for public blockchains. Polygon PoS supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster and cheaper transactions.

## Types of Interaction on Polygon

- [Polygon PoS chain](/docs/develop/getting-started)
- [Ethereum + Polygon with PoS bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started)
- [Ethereum + Polygon with Plasma bridge](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/plasma/getting-started)

## Deploy Smart Contracts

## What is a Blockchain?

Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Head over to [Blockchain Basics](blockchain-basics/basics-blockchain.md) to read more.

## What is a Sidechain?

Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a 'parent' blockchain, supporting transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

## Validator and delegator roles

On the Polygon Network, you can be a validator or a delegator. See:

- [Who Is a Validator](/docs/maintain/polygon-basics/who-is-validator)
- [Who Is a Delegator](/docs/maintain/polygon-basics/who-is-delegator)

## Architecture

If your goal is to become a validator, it is essential that you understand the Polygon architecture.

See [Polygon Architecture](/docs/maintain/validator/architecture).

### Components

To have a granular understanding of the Polygon architecture, see core components:

- [Heimdall](/docs/pos/heimdall/overview)
- [Bor](/docs/pos/bor/overview)
- [Contracts](/docs/pos/contracts/stakingmanager)

#### Codebases

To have a granular understanding of the core components, see the codebases:

- [Bor](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor)
- [Contracts](https://github.com/maticnetwork/contracts)

## How-tos

### Node setup

- [Run a Validator Node with Ansible](/docs/maintain/validate/run-validator-ansible)
- [Run a Validator Node from Binaries](/docs/maintain/validate/run-validator-binaries)

### Staking operations
